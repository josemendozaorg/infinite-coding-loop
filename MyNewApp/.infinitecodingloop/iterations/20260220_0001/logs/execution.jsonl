Your task is to analyze the project requirements and define the most appropriate architectural style and patterns.\n\n### Objectives:\n1. **Architectural Style**: Select and justify an architectural style (e.g., Monolithic, Microservices, Layered, Hexagonal, Event-Driven, Clean Architecture).\n2. **Design Patterns**: Identify and describe relevant design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy) that will be used.\n3. **Justification**: Provide a clear rationale for your choices based on project requirements, scalability needs, and maintainability goals.\n\n### Output Format:\n- Clearly state the chosen architectural style.\n- List and explain the key design patterns to be implemented.\n- Include a brief section on how this architecture addresses the project's specific constraints and requirements.\n\n\n### Context / Input:\n{\n  \"SoftwareApplication\": {\n    \"goal\": \"A simple hello world API\",\n    \"name\": \"MyNewApp\"\n  }\n}\n\nPlease generate the ArchitectureStyle artifact.\n\n**Tool-Driven Persistence Required**:\n1. You MUST use your tools (e.g., `write_file`) to persist the ArchitectureStyle content to the file `spec/architecturestyle.json`.\n2. Do NOT just output the text; you are responsible for the file creation.\n\n**Strict Output Rules**:\n1. Provide the ArchitectureStyle content as the ONLY output in a single triple-backtick JSON code block.\n2. Do NOT include any intro, outro, or multiple blocks. Do NOT nest triple-backticks inside values.","prompt_length":1497,"target":"ArchitectureStyle"}}
