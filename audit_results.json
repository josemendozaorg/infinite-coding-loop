When `new_cap + offset` overflows `usize` in release builds, this condition may incorrectly pass, causing `self.cap` to be set to a value that exceeds the actual allocated capacity. Subsequent APIs such as `spare_capacity_mut()` then trust this corrupted `cap` value and may create out-of-bounds slices, leading to UB.\n\nThis behavior is observable in release builds (integer overflow wraps), whereas debug builds panic due to overflow checks.\n\n## PoC\n\n```rs\nuse bytes::*;\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut a = BytesMut::from(&b\"hello world\"[..]);\n    let mut b = a.split_off(5);\n\n    // Ensure b becomes the unique owner of the backing storage\n    drop(a);\n\n    // Trigger overflow in new_cap + offset inside reserve\n    b.reserve(usize::MAX - 6);\n\n    // This call relies on the corrupted cap and may cause UB & HBO\n    b.put_u8(b'h');\n}\n```\n\n# Workarounds\n\nUsers of `BytesMut::reserve` are only affected if integer overflow checks are configured to wrap.
