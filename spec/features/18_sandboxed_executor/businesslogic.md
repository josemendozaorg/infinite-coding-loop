# Logic: 18_sandboxed_executor

## User Logic
- Safely run code generated by AI workers.
- Isolated output and side-effects.

## Technical Logic
- Docker SDK or CLI integration.
- Spawning short-lived containers for `npm test`, `cargo run`, etc.

## Implementation Strategy
1. Define `ExecutionEnvironment` trait.
2. Implement `DockerSandbox` backend.
3. Wire AI mission results to the execution sandbox for verification.
