# Data Model: 38_planner_worker

## WorkerRole (Enum)
- `Planner` (already exists).

## Task
- Task names will now include planning-specific tasks:
    - "Replan Task <ID>"
    - "Strategic Review"
- These tasks will likely have `assigned_worker: "Planner"`.

## Mission
- No changes to Mission struct itself, but Missions can now be dynamically generated by the Planner Worker.
