# Pulpo — Brand Identity

![Pulpo Logo](./pulpo-logo.png)

**Tagline:** *Deterministic and Creative AI*

---

## Name

**Pulpo** — Spanish for *octopus*. The name was chosen as a powerful metaphor for the system's architecture: an ontology-driven engine whose tentacles reach into every layer of a software project, connecting knowledge nodes just as an octopus connects its environment through its remarkable nervous system.

## Logo Concept

The logo is a geometric abstraction of an octopus fused with a brain, communicating three core ideas simultaneously:

### 1. The Octopus — Decentralized Intelligence
An octopus has nine brains: one central brain and one in each of its eight arms. Each arm can act independently, sensing and reacting to its environment without waiting for a central command. This mirrors **Pulpo's** architecture — a central ontology engine that empowers autonomous, intelligent agents across different domains (CLI, TUI, visualizer) while maintaining coherent, unified knowledge.

### 2. The Brain — Deterministic & Creative AI
The upper portion of the logo subtly forms a brain shape, representing the AI's dual nature:
- **Deterministic**: Ontology-driven reasoning that is predictable, reproducible, and auditable.
- **Creative**: The capacity to generate, explore, and synthesize novel solutions within a structured knowledge graph.

### 3. The Colombian Touch
The logo incorporates design elements inspired by **Pre-Columbian Colombian goldwork**, specifically the geometric patterns of the **Quimbaya** and **Zenú** cultures:
- **Gold tones** reference the legendary *El Dorado* and the masterful metallurgy of ancient Colombian civilizations.
- **Deep navy blue** evokes the Pacific and Caribbean coasts of Colombia.
- **Terracotta red** is a subtle nod to Colombian earth and the warmth of its culture.
- The **interlocking geometric patterns** within the tentacles are inspired by the abstract, symmetrical motifs found in Pre-Columbian gold artifacts displayed at the *Museo del Oro* in Bogotá.
