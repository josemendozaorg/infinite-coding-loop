  "addressingConstraintsAndRequirements": "This architectural design directly addresses the project's goal of a search web application by providing a robust and organized structure. The layered approach ensures that the user interface is decoupled from the business logic and data access, making the application easier to develop, test, and debug. The use of design patterns like Repository will allow for flexibility in how cheese data is retrieved (e.g., from a database, a JSON file, or an external API), which is crucial for a data-driven application. The clear separation of concerns will also facilitate future enhancements, such as adding more complex search criteria, user authentication, or integrating with other services, without requiring a complete overhaul of the existing codebase. The chosen patterns emphasize modularity and extensibility, ensuring the system remains maintainable and scalable as project requirements evolve.",
  "architecturalStyle": {
    "justification": "Given the project's objective of a simple web application for searching cheese types, a Layered Architecture provides clear separation of concerns, enhancing maintainability and allowing for independent scaling of components. It's a well-understood pattern for web applications, providing a solid foundation that can be extended if the application grows in complexity or requires more advanced features like user management or multiple data sources. The three main layers (Presentation, Application, and Data Access) ensure a structured approach to development.",

    {
      "description": "This pattern will abstract the data access logic from the business logic. It provides a clean API for retrieving and storing cheese data, making the application layer independent of the specific database or data source implementation. This allows for easier changes to the data storage mechanism in the future without impacting the core business logic.",

    {
      "description": "For the presentation layer, either MVC or MVVM will be employed to structure the web application. This separates the application's concerns into data (Model), user interface (View), and logic that handles user input and updates the model/view (Controller/ViewModel). This promotes modularity, testability, and responsiveness in the UI.",
      "name": "MVC (Model-View-Controller) / MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)"
    },
    {
      "description": "If the search functionality evolves to include different algorithms for filtering or sorting cheese types (e.g., by region, milk type, or aging process), the Strategy Pattern can be used. This allows different search/filter algorithms to be encapsulated into separate classes and selected dynamically at runtime, keeping the main search logic clean and extensible.",
